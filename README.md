A simple batch file to add all files to the staging area, committing with a message and pushing to a remote repo. I made this for a college class of mine.

Usage - gacp "commit message"

Please note that gacp requires an argument which becomes the commit message; else it won't work.

P.S. This was set up in a very specific way to cater to what I need to do in my class and since this is a batch file, this is meant only for Windows.
     I decided to make it public anyway because it was fun. I never thought I would have to look at 15 different websites and go through several variants
     of types of files (a C source code file, a ps1 powershell file even a Java file) before I could figure out what kind of file I needed to do what I was
     trying to. Working with technology is a humbling experience and I love it.
